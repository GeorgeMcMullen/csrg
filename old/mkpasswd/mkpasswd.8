.SH NAME
mkpasswd \- generate hashed password table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkpasswd
[
.B \-p
] passwdfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mkpasswd
is used to generated the hashed password database used by the
password library routines (see
.IR getpwent (3)).
.PP
The file
.I passwdfile
must be in password file format (see
.IR passwd (5)).
.I Mkpasswd
generates database files named ``passwdfile.pag'' and
``passwdfile.dir'' (see
.IR ndbm (3)).
Data subsequently taken from the database files differ from
.I passwdfile
in one respect.
Rather than storing the encrypted password in the database,
.I mkpasswd
stores the offset of the encrypted password in
.IR passwdfile .
.PP
.I Mkpasswd
exits zero on success, non-zero on failure.
.PP
The
.I \-p
option causes
.I mkpasswd
to create ``passwdfile.orig'', a password file in the
standard Version 7 format.
