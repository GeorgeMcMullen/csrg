.Sh NAME
.Nm ratfor
.Nd rational Fortran dialect
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ratfor
.Op Ar option ...
.Op Ar filename ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Ratfor
converts a rational dialect of Fortran into ordinary irrational Fortran.
.Nm Ratfor
provides control flow constructs essentially identical to those in C:
.Tw Fl
.Tp statement grouping:
{ statement; statement; statement }
.Tp decision-making:
.Ds I
if (condition) statement { else statement }
switch (integer value) {
\tcase integer:	statement
\t...
\t[default]: statement
}
.De
.Tp loops:
.Ds L
while (condition) statement
for (expression; condition; expression) statement
do limits statement
repeat statement [until (condition)]
break
next
.De
.Tp
.Pp
and some syntactic sugar to make programs easier to read and write:
.Tw Fl
.Tp free form input:
multiple statements/line; automatic continuation
.Tp comments:
# this is a comment
.Tp translation of relationals:
>, >=, etc., become .GT., .GE., etc.
.Tp return (expression)
returns expression to caller from function
.Tp define:
define name replacement
.Tp include:
include filename
.Tp
