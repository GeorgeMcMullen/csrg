/*
 * Scaled down version of C Library printf.
 * Used to print diagnostic information directly on console tty.
 *
 * One additional format: %b is supported to decode error registers.
 * Usage is:
 *	printf("reg=%b\n", regval, "<base><arg>*");
 * Where <base> is the output base expressed as a control character,
 * e.g. \10 gives octal; \20 gives hex.  Each arg is a sequence of
 * characters, the first of which gives the bit number to be inspected
 * (origin 1), and the next characters (up to a control character, i.e.
 * a character <= 32), give the name of the register.  Thus
 *	printf("reg=%b\n", 3, "\10\2BITTWO\1BITONE\n");
 * would produce output:
 *	reg=3<BITTWO,BITONE>
