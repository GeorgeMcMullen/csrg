.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Strncmp
compares at most
.I len
characters in the null-terminated strings
.I s1
and
.I s2
and returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
according as
.I s1
is lexicographically greater than, equal to, or less than
.IR s2 .
The comparison is done using unsigned characters, so that '\e200'
is greater than '\e0'.
