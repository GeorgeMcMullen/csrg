.SH NAME
symlink \- make symbolic link to a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
symlink(name1, name2)
char *name1, *name2;
.fi
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
A symbolic link
.I name2
is created to
.IR name1
(\fIname2\fP is the name of the
file created, \fIname1\fP is the string
used in creating the symbolic link).
Either name may be an arbitrary path name; the files need not
be on the same file system.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, a zero value is returned.
If an error occurs, the error code is stored in \fIerrno\fP
and a \-1 value is returned.
.SH "ERRORS
The symbolic link is made unless on or more of the
following are true:
.TP 15
[ENOTDIR]
A component of the \fIname2\fP prefix is not a directory.
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
Either \fIname1\fP or \fIname2\fP
contains a character with the high-order bit set.
.TP 15
[ENAMETOOLONG]

or the entire length of either path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.TP 15

\fIName2\fP already exists.
.TP 15
[EIO]

or allocating the inode for \fIname2\fP,
or writing out the link contents of \fIname2\fP.
.TP 15
[EROFS]
The file \fIname2\fP would reside on a read-only file system.
.TP 15

system containing the directory.
.TP 15

The new symbolic link cannot be created because there
there is no space left on the file
system that will contain the symbolic link.
.TP 15

symbolic link is being created.
.TP 15

The directory in which the entry for the new symbolic link
is being placed cannot be extended because the
user's quota of disk blocks on the file system
containing the directory has been exhausted.

quota of disk blocks on the file system that will
