.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fflush
writes any buffered data for the given output
.I stream
via the stream's underlying write function.
The stream remains open.

.I Fpurge
erases any input or output buffered in the given

For output streams this discards any unwritten output.
For input streams this discards any input read from the underlying object
but not yet obtained via
.IR getc ;
this includes any text pushed back via
.IR ungetc .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

Otherwise,
.B EOF
is returned and the global variable
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.

not a stream open for writing.
.PP
.I Fflush
may also fail and set
