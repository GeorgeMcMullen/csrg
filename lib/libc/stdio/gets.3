.SH NAME
gets - get a line from stdin
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <stdio.h>

char *gets(s)
char *s;
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft B
This interface is obsoleted by fgets(3).
As it makes no effort to avoid overwriting its buffer, 
it's a clear security problem.
.br
It is available from the compatibility library, libcompat.
.ft R
.PP
The
.I gets
function reads characters from the input stream pointed to by
.IR stdin ,
into the array pointed to by
.IR s ,
until end-of-file is encountered or a new-line character is read.
Any newline character is discarded, and a null character is written
immediately after the last character read into the array.
.PP
The
.I gets
function returns
.I s
if successful.
If end-of-file is encountered and no characters have been read into
the array, the contents of the array remain unchanged and a null
pointer is returned.
If a read error occurrs during the operation, the array contents
are indeterminate and a null pointer is returned.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
getc(3), ferror(3) fread(3), scanf(3)
.SH STANDARDS
The
.I gets
function is ANSI C compatible.
