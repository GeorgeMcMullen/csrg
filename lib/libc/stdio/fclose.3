.SH NAME
fclose \- close a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <stdio.h>

int
fclose(FILE *stream);
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fclose
dissociates the named
.I stream
from its underlying file or set of functions.
If the stream was being used for output, any buffered data is written
first, using
.IR fflush (3).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise,
.B EOF
is returned and the global variable
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
In either case no further access to the stream is possible. 
.SH ERRORS
.TP 15
[EBADF]
.I Stream
is not an open stream.
.PP
.I Fclose
may also fail and set 
.I errno
for any of the errors specified for the routines
.IR close (2)
or 
.IR fflush (3).
.SH STANDARDS
.I Fclose
conforms to ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'').
.SH "SEE ALSO"
close(2), fflush(3), fopen(3), setbuf(3)
