.RE
.PP
The fields have meanings described in
.IR fstab (5).
.PP
.I Setfsent
opens the file (closing any previously opened file) or rewinds it
if it is already open.
.PP
.I Endfsent
closes the file.
.PP
.I Getfsspec
and
.I getfsfile
search the entire file (opening it if necessary) for a matching special
file name or file system file name.
.PP
For programs wishing to read the entire database,
.I getfsent
reads the next entry (opening the file if necessary).
.PP
All entries in the file with a type field equivalent to
.I FSTAB_XX
are ignored.

.IR getfsspec ,
and
.I getfsfile

.I Setfsent
returns 0 on failure, 1 on success.
.I Endfsent
returns nothing.
