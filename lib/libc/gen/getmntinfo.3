.SH NAME
getmntinfo - get information about mounted file systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/mount.h>
.LP
.ft B
int getmntinfo(mntbufp, flags)
struct statfs **mntbufp;
int flags
.fi
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Getmntinfo
returns an array of
.I statfs
structures describing each currently mounted file system (see
.IR statfs (2)).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
On successful completion,
.I getmntinfo
returns a count of the number of elements in the array.
The pointer to the array is stored into
.IR mntbufp .
Otherwise, zero is returned and
.I mntbufp
is unmodified.
.PP
.I Getmntinfo
passes its
.I flags
parameter transparently to
.IR getfsstat (2).
.SH BUGS
All information is contained in a static area,
so it must be copied if it is to be saved.
.SH SEE ALSO
getfsstat(2), statfs(2), mount(2), mount(8)
