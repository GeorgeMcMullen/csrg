.B "Description"
.LP
If the process has a controlling terminal, the tcsetpgrp() function
shall set the foreground process group ID associated with the
terminal to pgrp_id.  The file associated with fildes must be the
controlling terminal of the calling process and the controlling
terminal must be currently associated with the session of the
calling process.  The value of pgrp_id must match a process group
ID of a process in the same session as the calling process.
.LP
.B "Returns"
.LP
Upon successful completion, tcsetpgrp() returns a value of zero.
Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error.
.LP
.B "Errors"
.LP
If any of the following conditions occur, the tcsetpgrp() function shall
return -1 and set errno to the corresponding value:
.nf
   [EBADF]       The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

   [EINVAL]      The value of the pgrp_id argument is a value not
                 supported by the implementation.

   [ENOSYS]      The tcsetpgrp() function is not supported in this
                 implementation.

   [ENOTTY]      The calling process does not have a controlling
                 terminal, or the file is not the controlling terminal,
                 or the controlling terminal is no longer associated with
                 the session of the calling process.

   [EPERM]       The value of pgrp_id is a value supported by the
                 implementation but does not match the process group ID
                 of a process in the same session as the calling process.
