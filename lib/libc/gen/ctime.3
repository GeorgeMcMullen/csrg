.SH NAME
asctime, ctime, difftime, gmtime, localtime, mktime \- convert date and time to ASCII

#include <sys/types.h>

char *ctime(time_t *clock);

double difftime(time_t time1, time_t time0);

#include <time.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR Ctime ,
.I gmtime
and
.I localtime
all take as an argument a time value representing the time in seconds since
the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970; see
.IR time (3)).
.PP
.I Localtime
converts the time value pointed at by
.IR clock ,
and returns a pointer to a ``struct tm'' (described below) which contains
the broken-out time information for the value after adjusting for the current
time zone (and any other factors such as Daylight Saving Time).
Time zone adjustments are performed as specified by the
.B TZ
environmental variable (see
.IR tzset (3)).
.I Localtime 
uses
.I tzset
to initialize time conversion information if
.I tzset
has not already been called by the process.
.PP
After filling in the tm structure,
.I localtime
sets the
.BR tm_isdst 'th
element of
.B tzname
to a pointer to an ASCII string that's the time zone abbreviation to be
used with
.IR localtime 's
return value.
.PP
.I Gmtime
similarly converts the time value, but without any time zone adjustment,
and returns a pointer to a tm structure (described below).
.PP
.I Ctime
adjusts the time value for the current time zone in the same manner as
.IR localtime ,
and returns a pointer to a 26-character string of the form:
.sp
.RS
Thu Nov 24 18:22:48 1986\en\e0
.RE
.sp
All the fields have constant width.
.PP
.I Asctime
converts a time value contained in a tm structure to a 26-character
string, as shown in the above example, and returns a pointer to the string.
.PP
.I Mktime
converts the broken-down time, expressed as local time, in the structure
pointed to by tm into a time value with the same encoding as that of the
values returned by the
.IR time (3)
function, that is, seconds from the Epoch, UTC.
.PP
The original values of the
.B tm_wday
and
.B tm_yday
components of the structure are ignored, and the original values of the
other components are not restricted to their normal ranges.
(A positive or zero value for
.B tm_isdst
causes
.I mktime
to presume initially that summer time (for example, Daylight Saving Time)
is or is not in effect for the specified time, respectively.
A negative value for
.B tm_isdst
causes the
.I mktime
function to attempt to divine whether summer time is in effect for the
specified time.)
.PP
On successful completion, the values of the
.B tm_wday
and
.B tm_yday
components of the structure are set appropriately, and the other components
are set to represent the specified calendar time, but with their values
forced to their normal ranges; the final value of
.B tm_mday
is not set until
.B tm_mon
and
.B tm_year
are determined.
.I Mktime
returns the specified calendar time; if the calendar time cannot be
represented, it returns
.BR -1 .
.PP
.I Difftime
returns the difference between two calendar times,
.RI ( time1
-
.IR time0 ),
expressed in seconds.
.PP
External declarations as well as the tm structure definition are in the 
``<time.h>'' include file.
The tm structure includes at least the following fields:
.sp
.RS
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'long tm_gmtoff;\0\0'u
int tm_sec;	/\(** seconds (0 - 60) \(**/
int tm_min;	/\(** minutes (0 - 59) \(**/
int tm_hour;	/\(** hours (0 - 23) \(**/
int tm_mday;	/\(** day of month (1 - 31) \(**/
int tm_mon;	/\(** month of year (0 - 11) \(**/
int tm_year;	/\(** year \- 1900 \(**/
int tm_wday;	/\(** day of week (Sunday = 0) \(**/
int tm_yday;	/\(** day of year (0 - 365) \(**/
int tm_isdst;	/\(** is summer time in effect? \(**/
char \(**tm_zone;	/\(** abbreviation of timezone name \(**/
long tm_gmtoff;	/\(** offset from UTC in seconds \(**/
.fi
.RE
.PP
.I Tm_isdst
is non-zero if summer time is in effect.
.PP
.I Tm_gmtoff
is the offset (in seconds) of the time represented from UTC, with positive
values indicating east of the Prime Meridian.
.SH SEE ALSO
date(1), gettimeofday(2), getenv(3), time(3), tzset(3), tzfile(5)
.SH BUGS
Except for 
.I difftime 
and
.IR mktime ,
these routines all return pointers to static data whose content is
overwritten by each call.
.PP
The
.B tm_zone
field of a returned tm structure points to a static array of characters,
which will also be overwritten by any subsequent calls (as well as by
subsequent calls to
.IR tzset (3)
and
.IR tzsetwall (3)).
.PP
Use of the external variable
.B tzname
is discouraged; the
.B tm_zone 
entry in the tm structure is preferred.
.PP
Avoid using out-of-range values with
.I mktime
when setting up lunch with promptness sticklers in Riyadh.
