.LP
The tcgetpgrp() function shall return the value of the process
group ID of the foreground process group associated with the
terminal.
.LP
.B "Returns"
.LP
Upon successful completion, tcgetpgrp() returns the process group ID of
the foreground process group associated with the terminal.  If there is
no foreground process group, tcgetpgrp() shall return a value greater
than 1 that does not match the process group ID of any existing process
group.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate
the error.
.LP
.B "Errors"
.LP
If any of the following conditions occur, the tcgetpgrp() function shall
return -1 and set errno to the corresponding value:
.nf
   [EBADF]       The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

   [ENOSYS]      The tcgetpgrp() function is not supported in this
                 implementation.

   [ENOTTY]      The calling process does not have a controlling terminal
                 or the file is not the controlling terminal.
