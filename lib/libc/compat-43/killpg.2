.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft B
killpg(pgrp, sig)
.br
int pgrp, sig;
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Killpg
sends the signal
.I sig
to the process group
.IR pgrp .
See

for a list of signals.
.PP
The sending process and members of the process group must
have the same effective user ID, or
the sender must be the super-user.
As a single special case the continue signal SIGCONT may be sent
to any process that is a descendant of the current process.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
a value of \-1 is returned and the global variable \fIerrno\fP
is set to indicate the error.
.SH "ERRORS
\fIKillpg\fP will fail and no signal will be sent if any of the
following occur:
.TP 15

\fISig\fP is not a valid signal number.
.TP 15

No process can be found in the process group specified by \fIpgrp\fP.
.TP 15

but the sending process does not have a process group.
