.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Quotacheck
examines each filesystem,
builds a table of current disk usage,
and compares this table against that recorded
in the disk quota file for the filesystem.
If any inconsistencies are detected, both the
quota file and the current system copy of the
incorrect quotas are updated (the latter only
occurs if an active filesystem is checked).
By default both user and group quotas are checked.
The optional \fI-g\fP flag specifies that only group quotas should be checked.
The optional \fI-u\fP flag specifies that only user quotas should be checked.
Specifying both \fI-g\fP and \fI-u\fP is equivalent to the default.
.PP
If the
.B \-a
flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
.I quotacheck
will check all the filesystems indicated in
.I /etc/fstab
to be read-write with disk quotas.
By default only the types of quotas listed in
.I /etc/fstab
are checked.
The optional \fI-g\fP flag specifies that only group quotas listed in
.I /etc/fstab
should be checked.
The optional \fI-u\fP flag specifies that only user quotas listed in
.I /etc/fstab
should be checked.
Specifying both \fI-g\fP and \fI-u\fP is equivalent to the default.
Parallel passes are run on the filesystems required,
using the pass numbers in
.I /etc/fstab
in an identical fashion to
.IR fsck (8).
.PP
Normally
.I quotacheck
operates silently.
If the
.B \-v
option is supplied,
.I quotacheck
will report discrepancies between the
calculated and recorded disk quotas.
.PP
.I Quotacheck
expects each filesystem to be checked to have a
quota files named
.I quota.user
and
.I quota.group
which are located at the root of the associated file system.
These defaults may be overridden in
.I /etc/fstab .
If a file is not present, 
.I quotacheck
will create it.
.PP
.I Quotacheck 
is normally run at boot time from the
.I /etc/rc.local
file, see
.IR rc (8),
before enabling disk quotas with
.IR quotaon (8).
.PP
.I Quotacheck
accesses the raw device in calculating the actual
disk usage for each user.
Thus, the filesystems
checked should be quiescent while
.I quotacheck
is running.
