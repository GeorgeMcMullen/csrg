.SH SYOPNSIS
.B slattach
ttyname [
.I baudrate
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Slattach
is used to assign a tty line to a network interface,
and to define the network source and destination addresses. The
.I ttyname
parameter is a string of the form ``ttyXX'', or ``/dev/ttyXX''.
The optional
.I baudrate
parameter is used to set the speed of the connection. If not specified, the
default of 9600 is used.
.PP
Only the super-user may attach a network interface.
.PP
To detach the interface, use `ifconfig
.I interface-name
down' after killing off the
.I slattach
process.
.I interface-name
is the name that is shown by
.B netstat(1)
.SH EXAMPLES
.ta 8
	slattach ttyh8
.br
	slattach /dev/tty01 4800
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Messages indicating the specified interface does not exit, the
requested address is unknown, the user is not privileged and
tried to alter an interface's configuration.
