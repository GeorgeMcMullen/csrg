.Dd 
.Dt MOUNT_CD9660 8
.Os NetBSD 0.9
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_cd9660
.Nd mount an ISO-9660 filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_cd9660
.Op Fl F Ar fsoptions
.Op Fl norrip
.Op Fl gen
.Op Fl extattr
.Pa special
.Pa node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mount_cd9660
command attaches the ISO-9660 filesystem residing on
the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time.
.Pp
If the filesystem includes Rockridge extensions, they are
used unless the
.Fl norrip
flag is used.  If that option is given to
.Nm
then the Rockridge extensions will be ignored.
.Pp
Version numbers on files are normally stripped on directory listings.
If you want to see those, use the
.Fl gen
flag.
Otherwise, if there are files with different version numbers on the disk,
only the last one will be listed.
In either case, you may open a file with or without explicitly stating the
version number.
.Pp
If a disk contains extended attributes, they are normally ignored.
You can enable the usage of extended attributes with the
.Fl extattr
flag.

.Sh BUGS
The cd9660 filesystem should support the original "High Sierra"
("CDROM001") format;
it does not.
.Pp
POSIX device node mapping is currently not supported.
.Pp
Version numbers are not stripped if Rockridge extensions are in use.
In this case, accessing files that don't have Rockridge names without
version numbers gets the one with the lowest version number and not
the one with the highest.
.Pp
The filesystem name might need some rethinking, and some would
say it should run as a user process.
.Pp
There is no ECMA support.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mount_cd9660
utility first appeared in NetBSD 0.8.
Handling of Rockridge extensions was added for NetBSD 0.9.
