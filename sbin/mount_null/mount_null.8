.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_null
.Nd mount a null layer, making a virtual copy of an existing filesystem sub-tree
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_null
.Op Fl F Ar fsoptions
.Ar target mount-point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mount_null
command makes a sub-tree of an existing filesystem visible
in another part of the global filesystem namespace.
This allows existing files and directories to be accessed
using a different pathname.
.Pp
Virtual file system sub-trees created by the null layer should
be identical to those created by the loopback
The virtual copy of a file system sub-tree created by the null
layer should be nearly identical to one created by
.Xr mount_lofs 8 .
The purpose of the null layer is to serve as a basis for future
layer development.
.Pp
An example of a layer constructed from the null layer is
the umap layer (see
.Xr mount_umap 8 ).
.Sh HISTORY
The
loopback filesystem
is
.Ud
