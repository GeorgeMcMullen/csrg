.SH NAME
portmap \- DARPA port to RPC program number mapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B portmap
[
.B \-d
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  "portmap command"  ""  "\fLportmap\fP \(em DARPA to RPC mapper"
.IX  DARPA "to RPC mapper \(em \fLportmap\fP"
.B Portmap
is a server that converts
.SM RPC
program numbers into
.SM DARPA
protocol port numbers.
It must be running in order to make
.SM RPC
calls.
.PP
When an
.SM RPC
server is started, it will tell
.B portmap
what port number it is listening to, and what
.SM RPC
program numbers it is prepared to serve.
When a client wishes to make an
.SM RPC
call to a given program number,
it will first contact
.B portmap
on the server machine to determine
the port number where
.SM RPC
packets should be sent.
.PP
.B Portmap
must be started before any
.SM RPC
servers are invoked.
.PP
Normally
.B portmap
forks and dissociates itself from the terminal
like any other daemon.
.B Portmap
then logs errors using
.IR syslog (3).
The
.B \-d
(debug) option prevents
.B portmap
from running as a daemon,
and causes errors and debugging information
to be printed to the standard error output.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
inetd.conf(5),
rpcinfo(8),
inetd(8)
.SH BUGS
If
.B portmap
crashes, all servers must be restarted.
