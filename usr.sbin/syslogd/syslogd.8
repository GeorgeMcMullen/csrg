.SH NAME
syslogd \- log systems messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
syslogd [\-f config_file] [\-m mark_interval] [\-p log_socket]
.fi
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Syslogd
reads and logs messages to the system console, log files, other
machines and/or users as specified by its configuration file.
The options are as follows:
.TP
.I -f
Specify the pathname of an alternate configuration file;
the default is ``/etc/syslog.conf''.
.TP
.I \-m
Select the number of minutes between ``mark'' messages;
the default is 20 minutes.
.TP
.I \-p
Specify the pathname of an alternate log socket;
the default is ``/dev/log''.
.PP
.I Syslogd
reads its configuration file when it starts up and whenever it
receives a hangup signal.
For information on the format of the configuration file,
see
.IR syslog.conf (5).
.PP
.I Syslogd
reads messages from the UNIX domain socket ``/dev/log'',
from an Internet domain socket specified in ``/etc/services'',
and from the special device ``/dev/klog'' (to read kernel messages).
.PP
.I Syslogd
creates the file ``/var/run/syslog.pid'', and stores its process
id there.
This can be used to kill or reconfigure
.IR syslogd .
.PP
The message sent to
.I syslogd
should consist of a single line.
The message can contain a priority code, which should be a preceding
decimal number in angle braces, for example, ``<5>''.
This priority code should map into the priorities defined in the
include file ``<sys/syslog.h>''.
