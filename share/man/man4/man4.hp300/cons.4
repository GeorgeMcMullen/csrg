.SH NAME
cons \- HP300 console interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
This release supports a ``virtual'' console device used for kernel
.I printf
messages and accessed in user mode via /dev/console.
It is virtual in the sense that it is attached to a hardware interface
at boot time.
Currently the choices are limited to:
a bit-mapped display acting as an
.I "internal terminal emulator"
(ITE),
the builtin serial interface (dca),
or a ``null'' console in that order.
.SH FILES
/dev/console
.SH "SEE ALSO"
tty(4), reboot(8)
.SH BUGS
You should be able to specify potential console devices at
.I config
time.
