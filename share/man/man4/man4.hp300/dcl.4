.SH NAME
dcl \- HP 98628A communications link
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "device		dcl0	at scode? flags 0x1"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 98628A is a buffered EIA RS-232C (CCITT V.28) communications interface.
It has one port with full modem control.
.PP
Each line attached to the 98628A behaves as described in
.IR tty (4).
Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates;
0, 50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800,
9600, 19200. See 
.IR tty (4)
for the encoding.
.PP
.I Flags
should be set to 1 if the line should be treated as hard-wired with
carrier always present, or to 0 if modem control is desired.
.PP
Use HP cable "98626 & 98628 opts.002, RS232-C DCE CABLE, 5061-4216" to attach non-modem devices.
Use HP cable "98626 & 98628 opts.001, RS232-C DTE CABLE, 5061-4215" to attach modems.
.PP
The 98628A has a 256 byte input silo and a 256 output silo. Input interrupts
happen on a per character basis.
.PP
The high water and low water marks in the kernel tty routines are totally
inappropriate for a device like this with a large input buffer.  Don't use
tandem mode if possible.  A fast system can handle input at 19.2K baud without
receive overflow.

For output to devices that make heavy use of XON/XOFF a write size of less
then 256 will improve performance marginally.

.SH BUGS
Breaks received at a faster rate then 1 break every second will be 
recognized as a single break.

Console use is not supported.

The RS-422/423/499, MTS-DSN/DL modes of the card are not supported.
