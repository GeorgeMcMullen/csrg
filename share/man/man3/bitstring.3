.SH DESCRIPTION
These macros operate on strings of bits.
.PP
.I Bit_alloc
returns a pointer of type
.I bitstr_t\ *
to sufficient space to store
.I nbits
bits, or NULL if no space is available.
.PP
.I Bit_decl
is a macro for allocating sufficient space to store
.I nbits
bits on the stack.
.PP
.I Bitstr_size
returns the number of elements of type
.I bitstr_t
necessary to store
.I nbits
bits.
This is useful for copying bit strings.
.PP
.I Bit_clear
and
.I bit_set
clear or set the zero-based numbered bit
.IR bit ,
in the bit string
.IR name .
.PP
.I Bit_nset
and
.I bit_nclear
set or clear the zero-based numbered bits from
.I start
to
.I stop
in the bit string
.IR name .
.PP
.I Bit_test
evaluates to zero if the zero-based numbered bit
.I bit
of bit string
.I name
is set, and non-zero otherwise.
.PP
.I Bit_ffs
stores in the location referenced by
.I value
the zero-based number of the first bit set in the array of
.I nbits
bits referenced by
.IR name .
If no bits are set, the location referenced by
.I value
is set to -1.
.PP
.I Bit_ffc
stores in the location referenced by
.I value
the zero-based number of the first bit not set in the array of
.I nbits
bits referenced by
.IR name .
If all bits are set, the location referenced by
.I value
is set to -1.
.PP
The arguments to these macros are evaluated only once and may safely
have side effects.
