.SH NAME
lorder \- list dependencies for object files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft B
lorder file ...
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I lorder
utility uses
.IR nm (1)
to determine interdependencies in the list of object files
specified on the command line.
.I Lorder
outputs a list of file names where the first file contains a symbol
which is defined by the second file.
.PP
The output is normally used with 
.IR tsort (1)
when a library is created to determine the optimum ordering of the
object modules so that all references may be resolved in a single
pass of the loader.
.SH EXAMPLES
.RS
ar cr library.a `lorder ${OBJS} | tsort`
.RE
.SH "SEE ALSO"
ar(1), ld(1), nm(1), ranlib(1), tsort(1)
