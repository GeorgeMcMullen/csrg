.Sh NAME
.Nm tail
.Nd deliver the last part of a file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tail
.Oo Cm \\*(Pm Ns Ar number
.Op Ns Cm lbc Op Ns Cm fr
.Oc
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tail
utility copies its input file to the standard output
beginning at a designated place.
The argument
.Ar number
is counted in
units of blocks, characters or lines (default),
according to the appended option suffixes
.Cm b , c
and
.Cm l .
Copying begins at the point in the file indicated by the
.Cm \\*(Pm Ns Ar number
option, where
.Cm + Ns Ar number
is a positive offset relative to the beginning of the file
and
.Cm \&- Ns Ar number
is a negative offset relative to the end of the file or standard
input.
.Pp
Appended options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm b
The argument
.Ar number
refers to blocks.
.It Cm c
The argument
.Ar number
refers to characters (bytes).
.It Cm f
Specifying
.Cm f
causes
.Nm tail
to not quit at end of file, but rather wait and try to read repeatedly
in hopes that the file will grow.
.It Cm l
The argument
.Ar number
refers to line.
.It Cm r
Lines are printed from
.Ar file
in reverse order.
The default for
.Ar r
is to print the entire file this way.
.El

The
.Nm tail
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
