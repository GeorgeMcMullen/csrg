.SH NAME
su \- substitute user id
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
su [ -Kflm ] [ login ]
.ft R
.nf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Su
requests the Kerberos password for
.I login
(or for ``\fIlogin\fP.root'', if no login is provided), and switches to
that user and group ID after obtaining a Kerberos ticket granting ticket.
A shell is then invoked.
.I Su
will resort to the local password file to find the password for
.I login
if there is a Kerberos error.
If
.I su
is executed by root, no password is requested and a shell
with the appropriate user ID is invoked; no additional Kerberos tickets
are obtained.
.PP
By default, the environment is unmodified with the exception of
.IR USER ,
.IR HOME ,
and
.IR SHELL .
.I HOME
and
.I SHELL
are set to the target login's default values.
.I USER
is set to the target login, unless the target login has a user ID of 0,
in which case it is unmodified.
The invoked shell is the target login's.
This is the traditional behavior of
.IR su .
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
\-K
Do not attempt to use Kerberos to authenticate the user.
.TP
\-f
If the invoked shell is
.IR csh (1),
this option prevents it from reading the ``.cshrc'' file.
.TP
\-l
Simulate a full login.
The environment is discarded except for
.IR HOME ,
.IR SHELL ,
.IR PATH ,
.IR TERM ,
and
.IR USER .
.I HOME
and
.I SHELL
are modified as above.
.I USER
is set to the target login.
.I PATH
is set to ``/bin:/usr/bin''.
.I TERM
is imported from your current environment.
The invoked shell is the target login's, and
.I su
will change directory to the target login's home directory.
.TP
\-m
Leave the environment unmodified.
The invoked shell is your login shell, and no directory changes are made.
As a security precaution, if the target user's shell is a non-standard
shell (as defined by \fIgetusershell\fP(3)) and the caller's real uid is
non-zero,
.I su
will fail.
.PP
The \-l and \-m options are mutually exclusive; the last one specified
overrides any previous ones.
.PP
Only users in group 0 (normally ``wheel'') can
.I su
to ``root''.
.PP
By default (unless the prompt is reset by a startup file) the super-user
prompt is set to ``#'' to remind one of its awesome power.
