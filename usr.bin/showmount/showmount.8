.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Showmount
shows status information about the NFS server on
.I host.

on the host. See "NFS: Network File System Protocol Specification, RFC1094,
Appendix A" for a detailed desciption of the protocol.

.TP
.B \-d
List directory paths of mount points instead of hosts
.TP
.B \-e
Show the
.I host's
exports list
.SH "SEE ALSO"
mount(1), mountd(8)
.SH BUGS
The mount daemon running on the server only has an idea of the actual mounts,
since the NFS server is stateless. Showmount will only display the information
as accurately as the mount daemon reports it.
