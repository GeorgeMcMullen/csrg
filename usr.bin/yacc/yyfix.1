.SH NAME
yyfix \- extract tables from y.tab.c
.SH SYNOPSIS
yyfix file [ tables ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Programs have historically used a script (often named ``:yyfix'') to
extract tables from the
.I yacc
generated file ``y.tab.c''.
As the names of the tables generated by the current version of
.I yacc
are different from those of historical versions of
.IR yacc ,
the shell script
.I yyfix
is provided to simplify the transition.
.PP
The first, required, argument to
.I yyfix
is the name of the file where the extracted tables should be stored.
.PP
If further command line arguments are specified, they are taken as
the list of tables to be extracted.
Otherwise,
.I yyfix
attempts to determine if the ``y.tab.c'' file is from an old or new
.IR yacc ,
and extracts the appropriate tables.
.PP
The tables ``yyexca'', ``yyact'', ``yypact'', ``yypgo'',
``yyr1'', ``yyr2'', ``yychk'', and ``yydef'' are extracted
from historical versions of
.IR yacc .
.PP
The tables ``yylhs'', ``yylen'', ``yydefred'', ``yydgoto'', ``yysindex'',
``yyrindex'', ``yygindex'', ``yytable'', ``yyname'', ``yyrule'' and
``yycheck'' are extracted from the current version of
.IR yacc .
.SH FILES
y.tab.c		File from which tables are extracted.
