.Dt KDUMP 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm kdump
.Nd display kernel trace data
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kdump
.Op Fl dnlTR
.Op Fl f Ar trfile
.Op Fl t Ar trstr
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Kdump
displays kernel trace files produced with
.Xr ktrace 1
in a human readable format.
Without the
.Fl f
flag,
.Nm kdump
reads the file
.Sq Pa ktrace.out
in the current
directory.
.Pp
Options:
.Tw Fl
.Tp Fl d
Display all numbers in decimal.
.Tp Fl n
Suppress ad hoc translations.  Normally
.Nm kdump
tries to decode many
system calls into a more human readable format.  For example, ioctl
values are replaced with the macro name and errno values are replaced
with the
.Li sys_errlist
string.  Suppressing this feature yields a more consistent
output format and is easily amenable to further processing.
.Tp Fl l
Loop reading end-of-file.
.Tp Fl T
Display absolute timestamps for each entry (seconds since epoch).
.Tp Fl R
Display relative timestamps (time since previous entry).
