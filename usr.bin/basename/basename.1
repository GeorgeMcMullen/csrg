.Sh NAME
.Nm basename , dirname
.Nd return file or directory portion of pathname
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm basename
.Ar string
.Op Ar suffix
.Nm dirname
.Ar string
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Basename
displays the file name portion of a path, as determined by the following
rules.
It first deletes any trailing slash
.Sq Li \&/
characters from
.Ar string ,
then any path prefix ending in a slash, and then
.Ar suffix ,
if specified.
The resulting string, and a terminating newline, is written to the
standard output.
.Pp
If the string resulting from the first two steps is the same as
.Ar suffix ,
the third step is skipped and the suffix doesn't change the resulting
string.
.Pp
If
.Ar string
consists entirely of slash characters, the resulting string is a single
slash character.
.Pp
.Nm Dirname
displays the directory portion of a path, as determined by the following
rules.
It first deletes any trailing slash characters from
.Ar string ,
then any trailing non-slash characters, then any trailing slash characters.
The resulting string, and a terminating newline, is written to the standard
output.
.Pp
If the string resulting from the first step has no slash characters,
the resulting string is a single
.Sq Li \&. .
.Pp
If
.Ar string
consists entirely of slash characters, the resulting string is a single
slash character.
.Pp
.Nm Basename
and
.Nm dirname
exit 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh EXAMPLES 
The following line sets the shell variable
.Ev DIR
to
.Pa /usr/bin ,
and the variable
.Ev FILE
to 
.Pa file .
.Pp
.Dl DIR=`dirname /usr/bin/file.c`
.Dl FILE=`basename /usr/bin/file .c`
